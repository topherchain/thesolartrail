Wheeling and dealing in the solar system

This is a simple command line economic game using The Expanse universe. The basics are buy low, travel, sell high, repeat. This might not be the most efficient method, but it was great for learning how python classes work.

The basic units to buy/sell are: water, helium, copper, food, crew, fuel but this could easily be expanded. Different regions of the solar system illicit different prices for goods. For example, water will be cheap near Earth but expensive on Jupiter's moons. There are some goods that get cheaper far awa from Earth. 

Options:
inventory - lists your supplies
map - tells where you are and distance to other locations
location - tells where you are and local market conditions
buy - purchase goods with available funds
sell - sell goods
travel - consumes fuel to travel based on distance
help - throws you an explanation

Feel free to fork and expand!
